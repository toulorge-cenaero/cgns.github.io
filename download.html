<b>Current Stable Release:</b>

 <a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v4.1.0"> CGNS Version 4.1.0</a><br><br>

This version implements: <br>
    &emsp; - CPEX42 (Storing bounding box of a grid, CGNS-149)<br>
    &emsp; - CPEX43 (Family hierarchy as a tree, CGNS-180)<br>
CGNS switched to using HDF5 compact storage for smaller datasets.<br><br>
The following APIs were removed: <br>
    &emsp; cgio_read_all_data, cgio_read_data, cgio_read_block_data<br>
    &emsp; cgio_read_all_data_f, cgio_read_data_f, cgio_read_block_data_f<br>

These APIs should be used instead:<br>

      &emsp; cgio_read_all_data_type, cgio_read_data_type, cgio_read_block_data_type<br>
      &emsp; cgio_read_all_data_type_f, cgio_read_data_type_f, cgio_read_block_data_type_f<br><br>

See RELEASE.txt for additional bug fixes.

<p><b>Historical Stable Releases:</b></p>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v4.0.0">
CGNS Version 4.0.0</a><br>
<p><b>Background</b> <a href="https://cgnsorg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CGNS/pages/220463122/Resolve+issue+with+release+s+3.4.0+version+compatibility+the+4.0.0+release+and+forward+compatibility.">[1]</a>: The CGNS versions are currently numbered as follows: "Version x.y, Revision z", or "Version x.y-z".The first number represents the "major" version number. <b>Within this number, the library maintains forward compatibility.</b></p>

<p><b>Issue</b>: With the introduction of CPEX 0041 "NGON modification proposal", CGNS 3.4.0 broke the convention of maintaining forward compatibility with-in the major versioning of CGNS.</p>

<p>Version 4.0.0 was released with CPEX 0041 implemented, (essentially this is CGNS 3.4.0 released as version 4.0.0).</p>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.4.1">
CGNS Version 3.4.1 (Patch) </a><br>
Patched version v3.4.1 removed CPEX 0041.
</li>
<p>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.4.0">
CGNS Version 3.4.0</a><br>
In addition to numerous bug fixes, this version added new features: CPEX 40 Rind Plane Indexing,
 CPEX 41 NGON modification proposal, added support for NAG Fortran compilers,
enforce the HDF5 version >= 1.8 is used in building HDF5, automatic detection and linking of szip and zlib if required by HDF5.
</li>
<p>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.3.0">
CGNS Version 3.3.0</a><br>
This Version implements CPEX 0038 and 0039, adds new functionality to the
parallel capability, and makes extensive changes related to the Fortran library.
<p>Important note for Fortran users:  V3.3 removes the usage of "include cgnslib_f.h".
Instead, from this release forward, one must now employ the module "use CGNS".
Also, if making use of 64-bit integers, Fortran programs must declare the
relevant 64-bit integers via, e.g.:  integer(cgsize_t) integername.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.2.1">
CGNS Version 3.2.1</a><br>
This Version 3.2 release provides partial
integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI. It also implements
the Hierarchy of families (CPEX 0033),
Multiple families (CPEX 0034), and Cubic elements (CPEX 0036).
Conversion programs to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen have also
been added to CGNStools.
<p>
Release 3.2.1 implements the suggestions by Cambridge Flow Solutions
to the CMake scripts and adds routines to set the MPI communicator
for parallel I/O. There are also numerous updates and fixes to the test
cases, tools and CGNStools utilities.
<p>
Note: CGNStools is no longer built automatically, you need to set
the configure flag, <em>--enable-cgnstools</em> if using configure.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.1.4">
CGNS Version 3.1.4</a><br>
Includes 64-bit integer capability
and updated Tools for viewing and editing CGNS files.
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> is now the default file type,
when CGNS is built with HDF5 version 1.8 or later.
(CGNS can always read or write both HDF5 and ADF
file types.)

<p>NOTE: CGNS has switched from SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns)
to GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/CGNS">https://github.com/CGNS</a>). 
Issue tracking is located at:
<a href="https://cgnsorg.atlassian.net">https://cgnsorg.atlassian.net</a>.
<!--Previous stable releases are still available on 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns/files/"> SourceForge</a>.-->

<p>
NOTE: if building CGNS with an HDF5 version <u>earlier</u> than 1.8, then links will not work
when using HDF5 file type.
</p>


<h2>Note about Linking CGNS with HDF5</h2>
<p>
When using HDF5, it is currently recommended that CGNS be compiled against the HDF5 1.8.x library. 
The following figure shows the typical performance of CGNS "make check" for various versions of HDF5 for 
serial I/O.
</p>

<p style="color:#9e1044">It is recommended to NOT link with HDF5 versions 1.10.0-patch1, 1.10.1 or 1.10.2.</p>

<img src="HDF5CGNS.png" alt="CGNS/HDF5 performance" style="width:860px;height:491px;">
   

<h2>Note about Compilers</h2>
<p>Users should be aware that many new features in CGNS require the use of up-to-date
compilers.  For example, older FORTRAN compilers that are not FORTRAN 2003 compliant (such as g77) will not
work for many CGNS features, and are not recommended or supported.
<!--Additionally, the use of a FORTRAN 2003 compliant compiler guarantees FORTRAN interoperability with the 
CGNS C library and, therefore, it is strongly recommended that FORTRAN 2003 coding standards be adopted 
in codes using CGNS when it is feasible to do so.-->

<h2>Note to Users of Version 2.5 CGNS</h2>
<p>Current users of Version 2.5 should read the following short guide:
<ul>
<a href="goingtoV3_3.pdf">Quick Guide to Upgrading from CGNS v2.5 to v3.x</a>
</ul> 
<p>which describes some of the reasons for upgrading to the latest version 3 software as well as how to
handle portability issues between versions.

<h2>Known Bugs/Issues in Latest Official (Stable) Release</h2>

<ul>
<li>Compression currently does not work for CGNS.
<li>When building with PGI and gcc compilers it might be necessary to set the
     environment variables:<br>
     <ul>
           <li> FLIBS="-Wl,--no-as-needed -ldl"
           <li> LIBS="-Wl,--no-as-needed -ldl"
     </ul>
