<p><b>March, 2020</b>: Version 4.1.0 of the CGNS Software is released. New features:

<ul>
  <li> Added CPEX42 Storing bounding box of a grid (CGNS-149).<br>
  <li> Added CPEX43 Family hierarchy as a tree (CGNS-180).<br>
</ul>

<p><b>Febuary, 2020</b>: Version 4.0.0 of the CGNS Software is released.

<ul>
  <li>  Added CPEX 41 NGON modification proposal (CGNS-121).
</ul>

<p><b>Febuary, 2020</b>: Version 3.4.1 (patch) of the CGNS Software is released.

<ul>
  <li>  Removed CPEX 41 NGON modification proposal (CGNS-121).
</ul>

<p><b>March 5, 2019</b>: Version 3.4.0 of the CGNS Software is released.
New features:
<ul>
  <li>  CPEX 40 Rind Plane Indexing (CGNS-87).
  <li>  CPEX 41 NGON modification proposal (CGNS-121).
  <li>  Added support for NAG Fortran compilers (CGNS-107).
  <li>  Enforce the HDF5 version >= 1.8 is used in building HDF5 (CGNS-150).
  <li>  Automatic detection and linking of szip and zlib if required by HDF5 (CGNS-156). 
</ul>

<p><b>July 16, 2017</b>: Version 3.3.1 of the CGNS Software is released.
New features:
<ul>
  <li> Serial and Parallel CGNS with Fortran enabled for Windows, PR-40.
</ul>

<p><b>January 25, 2016</b>: Version 3.3.0 of the CGNS Software released.
New features:
<ul>
  <li>Example build scripts for supercomputer systems can be found in src/SampleScripts 
      of the CGNS source code. They include scripts for building zlib, 
      hdf5 (assuming the user does not already have them installed system wide) 
      and a script for building CGNS. All the scripts use autotools; cmake remains untested.
  <li>The Fortran compiler environment variable can now be set with "FC", this is the preferred
      method.
  <li>The Fortran compiler flags can now be set with "FCFLAGS", this is the preferred method.
      If both FFLAGS (which predates FCFLAGS) and FCFLAGS are set then FCFLAGS is ignored.
  <li>Replaced the hid_t to double (and vice-versa) utilities to_HDF_ID and to_ADF_ID 
      from a type cast to a function which uses memcpy for the conversion. This is needed 
      for the upcomming release of HDF5 1.10 where hid_t was changed from a 32 bit integer 
      to a 64 bit integer. Should be transparent to user.
  <li>Implemented CPEX0039 : To enable with CGNS_ENABLE_BASE_SCOPE
  <li>Implemented CPEX0038 : Quadratic Elements for High Order
  <li>In the parallel library, the default parallel input/output mode was changed from CGP_INDEPENDENT 
      to CGP_COLLECTIVE.
  <li>In the parallel library, a new function was added for passing MPI info to the CGNS library:
      cgp_mpi_info (cgp_mpi_info_f).
  <li>In the parallel library, a new parallel example benchmark program, benchmark_hdf5.c, was added 
      to directory ptests.
  <li>In the parallel library, the cgp_*_read/write_dataset APIs now excepts non-allocated arrays, or NULL, 
      as valid parameters for the datasets. Additionally, the dimensional arrays, 
      rmin and rmax, can also be NULL. If the data array is NULL and the dimensional 
      arrays are not NULL, then the validity of the dimensional arrays, rmin and rmax, 
      is not checked. For collective parallel IO, this is used as a mechanism to 
      indicated that processes with NULL API parameters will not write any data to the file.
  <li>In the parallel library, cgp_queue_set and cgp_queue_flush were depreciated in this release.
  <li>SUPPORT WAS DROPPED FOR NON-FORTRAN 2003 COMPLIANT COMPILERS.
  <li>Configure was changed to check if the Fortran compiler is Fortran 2003 compliant.
  <li>In the Fortran library, the predefined CGNS constant parameters data types were changed from 
      INTEGER to ENUM, BIND(C) for better C interoperability. The users should use the 
      predefined constants whenever possible and not the numerical value represented by 
      the constants. A variable expecting an enum value returned from a Fortran API should be 
      declared, INTEGER(cgenum_t).
  <li>In the Fortran library, INCLUDE "cgnslib_f.h" was removed in favor of using a module, USE CGNS.
      - This allows defining a KIND type for integers instead of 
        the current way of using the preprocessor dependent cgsize_t.
  <li>The user should be sure to declare the arguments 
      declared int in the C APIs as INTEGER in Fortran. The ONLY 
      Fortran arguments declared as type cgsize_t should be the 
      arguments which are also declared cgsize_t in the C APIs. This 
      is very important when building with option --enable-64bit. The 
      test programs were updated in order to conform to this convention.
  <li>Assuming the rules in step [enu:int64] were followed, users 
      should not need to use parameter CG_BUILD_64BIT since Fortran's 
      cgsize_t is now guaranteed to match C's cgsize_t.
  <li>Fortran programs defining CGNS data types with a default 
      INTEGER size of 8 bytes also then need to compile the CGNS 
      library with the default INTEGER size of 8 bytes. This is 
      independent of whether or not --enable-64bit is being used. For 
      clarification, using --enable-64bit allows for data types (i.e. 
      those declared as cgsize_t) to be able to store values which 
      are too large to be stored as 4 byte integers (i.e. numbers 
      greater than 2,147,483,647). It is not necessary, or advisable 
      (since it waste memory), to have CGNS INTEGER types (types 
      declared int in C) to be 8 bytes; the variables declared as 
      cgsize_t will automatically handle data types that can not be 
      stored as 4 byte integers when --enable-64bit is being used. If 
      the CGNS library was not compiled with a default INTEGER of 8 
      bytes, but the calling program was, then all integers passed to 
      CGNS with C type int should be declared INTEGER(C_INT). 
  <li>A new Fortran API was added for determining the CGNS data type of a 
      variable which is interoperable with the C data type.<br>
      <br>
      Function cg_get_type(var)<br>
         type, INTENT(IN) :: var<br>
         INTEGER(KIND(enumvar)) :: cg_get_type<br>
      <br>
      An example of using the new function to automatically specify the CGNS 
      type corresponding to the Fortran data type is,<br>
      <br>
      INTEGER, DIMENSION(1:10) :: Array_i<br>
         CALL cgp_array_write_f("ArrayI",cg_get_type(Array_i(1)),1,INT(nijk(1),cgsize_t),Ai, err)<br>
      <br>
  <li>Removed all parallel flush/queue functions
  <li>Removed support of "include cgnslib_f.h", all examples and tests were updated to reflect these changes.
</ul>

<p><b>December 8, 2015</b>: Marc Poinot will be presenting a CGNS paper at AIAA SciTech in January:
"CGNS test suites for CFD software components", Thursday January 7, 2016 at 2pm in session MVC-02.

<p><b>December 7, 2015</b>: Release candidate version 3.3.0-rc1 is now available and an be downloaded from:
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases">https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases</a>.
Updates since the v3.3.0-alpha.2 release:
<ul>
   <li> Removed all parallel flush/queue functions (CGNS-9)
   <li> Removed support of “include cgnslib_f.h”, all examples and tests were updated to reflect these changes (CGNS-34)
   <li> Fixed parallel issue when not all processors involved in reading/writing (CGNS-51)
   <li> Fixed argument being passed to H5Pget_driver in ADFH.c (CGNS-50)
   <li> Added multiple Fortran and C tests to testing
   <li> Added a new PGI fortran compiler flag fix issue when passing to C varags (CGNS-40)
</ul>

<p><b>September 21, 2015</b>: Pre-release version 3.3.0 of CGNS is available for testing. Fortran testing
is particularly needed.

<p><b>May 19, 2015</b>: CGNS is making the move from SourceForge to GitHub.  New download website is
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS">https://github.com/CGNS</a>.  SourceForge still has old stable
releases (for the time being), but up-to-date code (via git) and future releases are all on
GitHub.
 
<p><b>December 2, 2014</b>: The CGNS Steering Committee voted to discontinue support
for FORTRAN compilers that are not Fortran 2003 compliant.  

<p><b>February 7, 2014</b>: The CGNS Steering Committee recently voted to take Version 3.2
off beta status.  As of this date, Version 3.2 is the default available from SourceForge.  This version 
integrates parallel I/O (using HDF5), and also implements CPEX 0033, 0034, and 0036.

<p><b>July 16, 2013</b>: Created
<a href="goingtoV3.pdf">Quick Guide to Upgrading from CGNS v2.5 to v3.x</a>, also 
available from the download page.

<p><b>July 15, 2013</b>: Release 2 of Version 3.1.4 is now available.
This release adds checks for an open file to routines that don't take a file number
(suggestion from Marc Poinet), adds HTMLHelp interface to cmake scripts,
fixes a compiler complaint about comparison between int and enum,
and fixes Fortran detection and MPI path problems in the CMake scripts.
Compatability with version 2.5 (file type <tt>CG_FILE_ADF2</tt>) is also
fixed for both <tt>CG_MODE_WRITE</tt> and <tt>CG_MODE_MODIFY</tt>.
The CGNStools documentation has been removed from the source distribution, and is now
accessed from the NASA Glenn server or a local copy (as with Version 3.2).

<p><b>July 15, 2013</b>: Version 3.2.1 (beta) is now available.
This release fixes a problem with IS_FIXED_SIZE macro for cubic elements
and adds AdditionalFamilyName to UserDefinedData. This also implements
the cmake script and MPI communicator changes proposed by
Cambridge Flow Solutions. There are also numerous updates to the test,
tools, and CGNStools utility programs.

<p><b>Feb 26, 2013</b>: Version 3.2 (beta) is now available.
This release provides full integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI.
It also implements the Hierarchy of families (CPEX 0033),
Multiple families (CPEX 0034), and Cubic elements (CPEX 0036).
Compression (rewriting) of modified CGNS files is no longer
automatically done, since this may interfere with parallel I/O. This
may be reenabled within an application with the <em>cg_set_compress</em>
function, or done later through the CGNSview GUI or with the
<em>cgnscompress</em> program in the <em>tools</em> subdirectory.
Conversion programs to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen have also
been added to CGNStools.

<p><b>Feb 13, 2013</b>: Version 3.1.4 is now available.
This release fixes some issues with goto for FamilyBCDataset for
UserData, .etc; fixes cmake and configure scripts to allow MPI with
HDF5 and some bugs in those scripts; updates CGNSplot to handle all element
types and 1-d and 2-d cases; updates to cgnscheck; adds cgnsBuild.defs
Makefile include to installation; allows CellCenter for BCs; and
adds cg_precision and cg_precision_f functions to get integer
size used to create the file (32 or 64).
<br>
<b>Note:</b> CGNStools no longer built automatically, you need to set
the configure flag, <em>--enable-cgnstools</em> if using configure.

<p><b>January 15, 2012</b>: Release 4 of Version 3.1.3 is now available.
This release fixes an issue with descriptors under
FamilyBCDataSet_t nodes; changes NormalIndexFlag to NormalIndexSize
for cg_boco_info; and adds a new Fortran routine cg_exit_on_error_f.
This function allows a Fortran application to set a flag which will
cause the program to print an error message and exit automatically
if an error is encountered.

<p><b>December 19, 2011</b>: Release 3 of Version 3.1.3 is now available.
This release adds a HDF5 CRT_ORDER fix and corrects the directory search order for linked files.
Also newly available are complete V2.5 or V3.1 documentation in the form of Windows compiled HTML files (chm).
If you are using Windows or have a CHM viewer on Linux you can download these from the download page
on the CGNS website or directly from SourceForge.

<p><b>April 25, 2011</b>: Version 3.1.3 released.
This release includes a fix to return HDF5 children in creation order.
It also includes the implementation of CPEX 0027 (Time-dependent
Connectivities), CPEX 0030 (Zone Sub-Regions) and CPEX 0031 (General SIDS
Improvements), along with the alpha release of Parallel CGNS. These
are described in the online documentation.

<p><b>March 30, 2011</b>: Version 3.1 updated and released as Version 3.1-2.
This release implements the bug fixes by Xiangmin Jiao (Jim), and adds
two new functions to more easily read and write GridLocation data for
boundary conditions, <tt>cg_boco_gridlocation_read</tt> and
<tt>cg_boco_gridlocation_write</tt>.

<p><b>March 13, 2011</b>: Version 3.1 updated and released as Version 3.1-1. This release
fixes a bug with relative path names for ADF links and some cmake
configuration options related to non-standard X installations
and warning messages. Also, the configure script no longer supports
multiple machine builds in the same directory due to the
machine-dependent header files that are created.

<p><b>March 1, 2011</b>: Version 3.1 has been officially released.
This release includes 64-bit capability. The changes from version 3.0 beta is the
reordering of the element types to put PYRA_13 after MIXED and the 64-bit support.
Most of the documentation has been updated to identify the changes.

<p><b>Feb 1, 2011</b>: Version 3.1 has recently been committed to the SVN repository on
SourceForge.  It has not been bundled up for release yet, but interested users can
access it from the SVN repository.
This version has true 64-bit capabilities, which overcomes the previous 32-bit
integer limitation and allows the writing of <u>very</u> large grids.  UserGuide example
codes have also been updated to V3.1, to be able to take advantage of the 64-bit capability.

<p><b>May 25, 2010</b>: Version 3.0.8 (Beta) has been released as a tarred source release 
on SourceForge. Parallel CGNS Version 0.2.0 (Alpha) is now available as well. 
A <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cgns">CGNS MediaWiki page</a> has been 
created.

<p><b>August 26, 2009</b>: Version 3.0.5 (Beta) released. This Beta version
is intended for users to perform preliminary testing. Many
changes have been made from 2.5, but a few of the more noticeable ones include the
following:  (1) Build system has been changed from autotools to CMake,
(2) Moving forward the HDF5 back-end will have preference, 
(3) cgnscalc and cgnssh have been disabled since they do not currently work.
The new beta can be downloaded from the subversion repository at
SourceForge.

<p><b>August 22, 2009</b>: Version 2.5.4 released.  
This release fixes a long standing issue of memory leakage in the CGNS library
when closing a file or deleting a node. It also removes the internal storage
of element data when reading and writing, and uses the user supplied buffer
instead. In the case of partial reads and writes however, the element data is
currently reloaded into memory to do the operations.

<p><b>March 11, 2007</b>: Version 2.5.3 released. This version changes
the mispelled Celcius to Celsius, fixes handling of soft links when rewriting the 
CGNS file, and fixes a number of gcc compiler warnings.

<p><b>September 11, 2007</b>: A new instructor-led AIAA short course is being offered starting
at the Aerospace Sciences Meeting in Reno, NV, January 5-6, 2008: "Effective Use 
of the CFD General Notation System (CGNS) for Commercial and Research Applications."
A description can be found by going to:
<a href="http://www.aiaa.org">www.aiaa.org</a>.
Click on "Courses & Training", then "Schedule".  The CGNS course is listed under
the Heading: January 2008.  Or go directly to:
<a href="http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=161&lumeetingid=1976&viewpd=overview">Summary of Short Course</a>.

<p><b>September 7, 2007</b>: Version 2.5 taken off beta status.
This new release adds "CG_"
prefixes to the C preprocessor defines MODE_xxx, Null, and UserDefined. For
example, MODE_READ is now CG_MODE_READ and Null is now CG_Null. The old
defines are still currently supported. Support has been added to build the
cgns library as a DLL under Windows. The NormalIndex arguments to
cg_boco_info, cg_boco_normal_write are now optional (pass as 0 or NULL to
ignore). Moved some of the CGNS utility programs, such as cgnscheck, to the
subdirectory 'tools' in the cgns distribution. This may now be built without
building cgnstools.  Also, final release of cgnsib_2.4 made (primarily an 
update of version number from 2.42 to 2.46, and some minor bug
fixes). The last digit on the version number is now ignored when reporting
that a file was created with a newer version than the current library.
Finally, in cgnstools, changed cgnsplot to use a tree layout instead of lists, and
added a cutting plane for viewing mesh cross-sections. Fixed a long standing
bug in cgns_interpolate which was causing that program to work incorrectly
or crash. Also added a VTK file export routine for CGNS files.

<p><b>October 5, 2006</b>: Version 2.5 (beta) of the CGNS library has been released
(cgnslib_2.5-1.tar.gz). This fixes problems with partial read and
writes, and adds some additional capabilities (goto operation enhancements,
type names, new cgns file checker, setting path to search for links, and
new routine for configuring CGNS).  Documentation is not available yet.
Look in the "tests" subdirectory at "test_partial.c" and "test_goto.c" for
examples of the use of these routines.
In addition, there are 2 other new releases for download from SourceForge:
(1) cgnslib_2.4-5.tar.gz: This release fixes some problems 
with ADF on Windows 64 bit machines, and
adds a -64 option to the configure.bat file. (2) cgnstools-2-5-1.tar.gz:  
Adds support for CGNS version 2.5. Configures the Tcl/Tk GUI to use the
current color scheme rather than a "Windows" type color scheme. Fixes some
minor bugs and adds some improvement to the cgnscheck program. Allows
reading of both HDF5 and ADF - based CGNS files (requires the adf2hdf and
hdf2adf convertor programs). 

<p><b>Spring, 2006</b>: There are two special
CGNS "events" planned for the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) meeting being held
5-8 June 2006 in San Francisco.
The first is a Panel discussion, tentatively titled
"CGNS Practical Applications in CFD". This will occur
during the regular AIAA sessions at the conference.
The second is a "CGNS Tutorial Session", currently
scheduled for Wednsday, 7 June 2006 in the evening. This
session will be conducted in two parts: (1) Basic usage
of CGNS (including examples for structured and unstructured
grids), and (2) Advanced topics (tentatively including
HDF-5 usage, parallel implementation, and SIDS high level
representation).  The tutorial session will be taught by
five experienced users/developers of CGNS and will be
a <b>great</b> way to either get a basic introduction or to
refine your knowledge of CGNS.
Note that AIAA charges a registration fee
for conference attendance, but there is no additional fee
to attend the CGNS events.

<p><b>August 23, 2005</b>: New releases of Version 2.3 and
2.4 of the CGNS library and CGNStools. This is the final release for Version
2.3 - Version 2.4 is now the official version. The CGNS library releases
fixed a bug in cg_family_write and others where the wrong file (when multiple
are open) might be accessed or a segfault occur. Added unstructured mesh
rind to Version 2.4, and support for that in CGNSplot and cgnscheck. Improved
the Fortran to C interface, particularly under Windows, Also fixed some
minor bugs in the CGNStools and improved the cgnscheck program.

<p><b>August 8, 2005</b>: CGNStalk discussion list moved from
<i>cgnstalk@grc.nasa.gov</i>
to <i>cgnstalk@lists.nasa.gov.</i>

<p><b>May 14, 2005</b>: Version 2.4 (Revision 2) of the CGNS library released.
The HDF5 interface (ADFH) may now be selected at build time with the configuration
script. Fixed some bugs.

<p><b>December 2, 2004</b>: Version 2.4 (beta) of the CGNS library has
been released. This version includes the extensions by Intelligent Light.
These extensions include 8 base units, partial read/write, Electromagnetics,
1tot1 connectivity properties, and extensions to the FamilyBC, BCDataSet
and UserDefinedData. Preliminary documentation for these extensions in
the form of PDF files is also available for download.&nbsp;

<p><b>October 1, 2004</b>: Released an update to Version 2.3 of the CGNS
library. This update fixes some problems with MLL routines returning the
wrong error code (or terminating prematurely). Also, checks are now performed
when creating a CGNS file to prevent writing a file which fails to read.
A new version of cgnstools has also been released with improvements to
both adfviewer and cgnsplot. The cgnscheck program has been significantly
improved. It should now check the validity of all CGNS 2.3 nodes.&nbsp;

<p><b>March 22, 2004</b>: ADFH has been released as beta. This is a complete
implementation of CGNS using HDF5 instead of ADF.&nbsp;

<p><b>January 22, 2004</b>: Version 2.3 of the CGNS library has been released.
The major changes in this version over that of 2.2 is a significant speedup
in reading and writing when dealing with a large number of zones and the
reimplementation of ElementList and ElementRange for specifying boundary
conditions.&nbsp;

<p><b>December 13, 2003</b>: An initial prototype has been released which
replaces ADF with HDF5. Thanks to Marc Poinot at Onera and Greg Power's
group at Arnold. The source is currently only available with CVS as module
<i>adfh</i>.&nbsp;

<p><b>September 28, 2003</b>: CGNS library Version 2.3 beta release. This
version currently adds no additional functionality to that of Version 2.2,
but speeds up read/write times by orders of magnitude when a large number
of zones are present.&nbsp;
